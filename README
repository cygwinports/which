which
-------------------------------------------
GNU Which prints out the full path of the executables that bash(1) would
execute when the passed program names would have been entered on the
shell prompt. It uses the exact same algorithm as bash. Tildes and a dot
in the PATH are now expanded to the full path by default. Options allow
users to print "~/*" or "./*" and/or to print all executables that match
any directory in the PATH.
