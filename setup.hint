ldesc: "GNU Which prints out the full path of the executables that
bash(1) would execute when the passed program names would have been
entered on the shell prompt. It uses the exact same algorithm as bash.
Tildes and a dot in the PATH are now expanded to the full path by
default. Options allow users to print "~/*" or "./*" and/or to print all
executables that match any directory in the PATH."
